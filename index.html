    <p> Hello! There is some information about me:) </p>
    <p> I am 18 years old.
        <br> I am the first year student of Ala-Too International University which is located in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.
        <br> My ORT score is 211, and I am studying at the faculty of Engineering & Informatics with 75% discount. 
        I graduated school with honors and received the <b>'Altyn Tamga'</b> award. 
        <br><br>In my free time, in addition to programming, I am:
        <ul>
            <li> reading books</li>
            <li> learning languages </li>
            <li> taking photos</li>
            <li> listening to music </li>
            <li> drawing, singing, doing everything related to art</li>
            <li> doing sports</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>Like every self-respecting person born in the CIS, I can speak 5 languages:Kyrgyz, Kazakh, Russian, English, German.
        <br> Web-design is something new for me, but I already like it very much, and dreaming about making fabulous sites,<br>
        that would give you 'WOW' reaction. <br> In the meantime, please evaluate my modest, but quite involving first site.
